# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
step 1:

Define a function.

step 2:

Get the two numbers from the user.

step 3:

Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.

step 4:

Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.


## Program:
```

def gcd():
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    while b!=0:
       a,b=b,a%b
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",a)       
```

## Output:
